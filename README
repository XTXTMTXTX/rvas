This is a RISC-V assembler.  It can only compile to raw format which
means the output is just the instructions you write in the assembly
file, no ELF headers or anything like that.


How to compile
--------------

Just compile rvas.c. Here is a command example:

cc rvas.c -o rvas


How to run
----------

The program takes the assembly file as argument and writes to standard
out. Here is a command example:

rvas mycode.asm > myprogram
